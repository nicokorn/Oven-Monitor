# Oven-Monitor
A java application used with a agilent (today keysight) datalogger to log temperatures from 40 pt100 sensors. The application is connected through ethernet to the datalogger. Every sensor can be monitored and limits can be set to send alarm emails. Also logged temperature data in a chosen time range can be exported as .csv files.
